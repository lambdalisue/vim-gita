==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*gita-introduction*

*gita* is a git manipulation plugin which allow users to perform daily git
operation within Vim's live session.

With gita, users can:

- Manipulate the index of the git repository
  - Stage content changes into the index (git add/git rm)
  - Unstage content changes from the index (git reset)
  - Partially stage content changes into the index (git add -p)
  - Partially unstage content changes from the index (git reset -p)
  - Solve conflict files by using 1, 2, or 3-way diff
- Edit a commit message and commit the index into HEAD
- Edit, show, diff files in
  - A working tree of the git repository
  - A index of the git repository
  - A specified commit, branch, etc. of the git repository
- List
  - Files in the working tree of the git repository
  - Files in the index of the git repository
  - Files in a specified commit, branch, etc. of the git repository
  - Files contains specified patterns
  - Files changes between commits
- Blame a file content

And lot more.

gita uses a git repository which

- A current file-like buffer belongs
- A current working directory belongs
- An original file of the pseudo file-like buffer belongs

You may notice that this behavior is quite useful when you temporary open a
file in a different git repository or in a non file-like buffer such as help
or quickfix.

Additionally, gita aggressively uses cache mechanisms to improve its'
performance. You would notice huge performance improvement if you are
currently using |system()| to show git repository informations in |statusline|
such as a current branch name or the number of modified files.


==============================================================================
INSTALL						*gita-install*

Use your favorite Vim plugin manager such as junegunn/vim-plug,
Shougo/dein.vim or whatever like:
>
	" vim-plug
	Plug 'lambdalisue/vim-gita'

	" dein.vim
	call dein#add('lambdalisue/vim-gita')

	" dein.vim (lazy)
	call dein#add('lambdalisue/vim-gita', {
		\ 'on_cmd': 'Gita',
		\})
<
Or copy contents of the repository into your |runtimepath| manually.


==============================================================================
USAGE						*gita-usage*

First of all, all commands which gita provides start from |:Gita| and all
commands (including |:Gita| itself) provide -h/-help option to show a help
message of the command.

Additionally, hitting ? in a manipulation window (e.g. |gita-status|) shows
action and mapping helps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS					*gita-usage-status*

To check or modify current statuses of a git repository, use |:Gita-status|
command like:
>
	:Gita status
<
It opens a *gita-status* window which looks like:
>
	             ┌ A repository name
	             │      ┌ A local branch name
	             │      │         ┌ A remote name
	             │      │         │    ┌ A remote branch name
	             │      │         │    │
	status of gita/alpha-3 <> origin/alpha-3 | Press ? ...
	 M autoload/gita/command.vim
	M  doc/gita.txt
	│            │
	│            └ A modified filename
	└ A current status of a file (Short formt)
<
The status of each modified files are shown as short format. If you are not
familiar with short format, check a |gita-usage-status-cheetsheet| or
a manpage of git-status.

					*gita-usage-status-cheetsheet*
	X          Y     Meaning ~
	          [MD]   not updated
	M        [ MD]   updated in index
	A        [ MD]   added to index
	D         [ M]   deleted from index
	R        [ MD]   renamed in index
	C        [ MD]   copied in index
	[MARC]           index and work tree matches
	[ MARC]     M    work tree changed since index
	[ MARC]     D    deleted in work tree

	D           D    unmerged, both deleted
	A           U    unmerged, added by us
	U           D    unmerged, deleted by them
	U           A    unmerged, added by them
	D           U    unmerged, deleted by us
	A           A    unmerged, both added
	U           U    unmerged, both modified

	?           ?    untracked
	!           !    ignored

In that window, users can manipulate or check statuses by the following
mappings:
					*gita-usage-status-mapping*
	Key		Description ~

	?		Show an action and mapping help
	<Tab>		Select an action to perform

	<<		Stage changes of a file
	>>		Unstage changes of a file
	--		Toggle stage/unstage of a file

	bb		Start a system browser to show the remote URL
	pp		Start a patch (partially stage/unstage changes)
	!!		Start a chaperone (help to solve conflicts)
	BB		Start a blame (a gita style blame)

	ee		Edit a working tree file
	EE		Edit a working tree file (split to right)
	et		Edit a working tree file (in a new tabpage)
	ep		Edit a working tree file (in a preview window)

	ss		Show a content of the file in the index
	SS		Show a content of the file in the index (right)
	st		Show a content of the file in the index (tabpage)
	sp		Show a content of the file in the index (window)

	dd		Show a diff to the index
	DD		Show a diff to the index (right)
	dt		Show a diff to the index (tabpage)
	dp		Show a diff to the index (preview)
	ds		Open vimdiff (two buffers) to the index
	DS		Open vimdiff (two buffers) to the index (tabpage)

	<CR>		Same as ee

	<C-^>		Switch to |gita-commit| window

Note that the mapping table above is partial. Hit ? on the window to see a
full mapping table.

A general workflow is:

	1. Open a |gita-status| window by :Gita status
	2. Hit dp to check if the changes are correct
	3. Hit ee/EE to edit codes
	4. Hit pp to patch changes to the index or << to stage entire content
	5. Hit <C-^> to switch to a |gita-commit| window

See |gita-usage-commit| for the further workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATCH					*gita-usage-patch*

To partially stage or unstage changes (like git add -p or git reset -p), use
|:Gita-patch| command on a corresponding file buffer like:
>
	:Gita patch
<
It opens three |vimdiff| windows which indicates a contents of

	1. HEAD (gita://<refname>:show/HEAD:<filename>)
	2. Index (gita://<refname>:show:patch/:<filename>)
	3. Working tree (<filename>)

In INDEX window, all changes saved is patched to the index of the repository.
Users can obtain changes from HEAD or Working tree by the following mappings:
				*gita-usage-patch-INDEX-mapping*
	Key		Description ~

	dol		Obtain a diff chunk from HEAD (left)
	dor		Obtain a diff chunk from Working tree (right)

	<C-l>		Perform |diffupdate| and |redraw()|

In HEAD or Working tree window, the following mappings are available:
				*gita-usage-patch-HEAD-mapping*
				*gita-usage-patch-WORKTREE-mapping*
	Key		Description ~

	dp		Put a diff chunk to Index

	<C-l>		Perform |diffupdate| and |redraw()|

Once you patch changes, see |gita-usage-commit| to commit changes.

Note that if you prefer to use 1-way (edit a single diff file) or 2-way (open
two buffer HEAD vs Index or Index vs Working tree) patch, see |:Gita-patch|
for a corresponding option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFLICT				*gita-usage-conflict*
					*gita-usage-chaperone*

If you have several conflicted files, use |:Gita-chaperone| command on a
conflicted file buffer like:
>
	:Gita chaperone
<
It opens three |vimdiff| windows which indicates a contents of

	1. LOCAL (gita://<refname>:show/:2:<filename>)
	2. MERGE (<filename>)
	3. REMOTE (gita://<refname>:show/:3:<filename>)

In MERGE window, all conflict markers (e.g. <<<<<<< HEAD) are removed and a
content of an ancestor commit between LOCAL and REMOTE are written
automatically. Users can then obtain changes from LOCAL or REMOTE by the
following mappings:
				*gita-usage-chaperone-MERGE-mapping*
	Key		Description ~

	dol		Obtain a diff chunk from LOCAL (ours)
	dor		Obtain a diff chunk from REMOTE (theirs)

	<C-l>		Perform |diffupdate| and |redraw()|

In LOCAL or REMOTE window, the following mappings are available:
				*gita-usage-chaperone-LOCAL-mapping*
				*gita-usage-chaperone-REMOTE-mapping*
	Key		Description ~

	dp		Put a diff chunk to MERGE

	<C-l>		Perform |diffupdate| and |redraw()|

Once you solve conflicts, see |gita-usage-status| to stage changes.

Note that if you prefer to use 1-way (edit a single diff file) or 2-way (open
two buffer LOCAL vs MERGE or MERGE vs REMOTE) chaperone, see |:Gita-chaperone|
for a corresponding option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMIT					*gita-usage-commit*

To commit changes in the index, use |:Gita-commit| command like:
>
	:Gita commit
<
It opens a *gita-commit* window which looks like:
>
	             ┌ A repository name
	             │      ┌ A local branch name
	             │      │         ┌ A remote name
	             │      │         │    ┌ A remote branch name
	             │      │         │    │
	# status of gita/alpha-3 <> origin/alpha-3 | Press ? ...
	#  M autoload/gita/command.vim
	# M  doc/gita.txt
	# │            │
	# │            └ A modified filename
	# └ A current status of a file (Short form)
<
The status of each modified files are shown as short format. If you are not
familiar with short format, check a |gita-usage-status-cheetsheet| or
a manpage of git-status.

In that window, users can edit a commit message and commit the changes by the
following mappings:
					*gita-usage-commit-mapping*

	DS		Open vimdiff (two buffers) to the index (tabpage)

	<CR>		Same as dd

	<C-^>		Switch to |gita-status| window
	<C-c><C-n>	Re-open |gita-commit| window without --amend option
	<C-c><C-a>	Re-open |gita-commit| window with --amend option
	<C-c><C-c>	Commit changes

Note that the mapping table above is partial. Hit ? on the window to see a
full mapping table.

A general workflow is:

	1. Hit dp to check if the changes are correct
	2. Write a commit message
	3. Close the window by :wq and answer 'y' to commit

Note that when the window is going to close, gita ask users to wheter user
want to commit the changes or not. The default value of that prompt is 'y' so
users can commit by hitting <Return> or cancel by <Esc> at that point. Or
explicitly commit by hitting <C-c><C-c>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES					*gita-usage-changes*
					*gita-usage-diff-ls*

To see which files are changed from a particular commit such as an ancestor
commit of a current branch (a fork-point of a branch from remote HEAD), use

STATUSLINE				*gita-usage-statusline*

gita provides a statusline components which returns a |String| available in
|statusline|.
The components aggressively cache statuses to improve the performance so you
would notice a huge performance improvement if you are currently using
|system()| to get git informations.

Use |gita#statusline#preset()| to get presets or |gita#statusline#format()| to
create your own components like:
>
	echo gita#statusline#preset('branch')
	" => 'gita/master <> origin/master'
	echo gita#statusline#preset('status')
	" => '!5 +2 "4 *4'
	echo gita#statusline#preset('traffic')
	" => '<5 >4'

	echo gita#statusline#format('%ln/%lb # %rn/%rb')
	" => 'gita/master # origin/master'
<
Use components above to customize your |statusline| like:
>
	let &statusline = &statusline . "%{gita#statusline#preset('branch')}"
<
The code above add a current branch name to the end of your statusline.

INTERFACE				*gita-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS				*gita-interface-commands*

					*:GitaClear*
:GitaClear

	Clear a git repository cache of the current buffer.
	You should not be required to call this command unless you remove .git
	directory or execute git init out side of Vim.

	Note that you may miss that |:edit| or |:edit!| reload the content of
	the buffer so use these command to update content.

					*:Gita*
:Gita[!] {args}

	Execute a git command. If a bang (!) is specified, it executes a git
	command by |:!|. Otherwise it uses Vital.System.Process.execute()
	which may use |system()| or vimproc#system() internally.

	Note that a bang is required to execute an interactive command (such
	as "git rebase -i") in a console vim. In a GUI Vim, most of
	interactive commands would crash a screen in a Unix system.

	A {args} will be split with non escaped and non enclosed spaces.
	So use one of the following pattern to apply space containing value to
	options.
>
	:Gita tag -a v1.0.0 -m 'Version 1.0.0'
	:Gita tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
	:Gita tag -a v1.0.0 -m Version\ 1.0.0
<
	Note that each values split from {args} are expanded by
	|gita#meta#expand()| and all escaped spaces in {args} will be
	un-escaped.

AUTOCMDS				*gita-interface-autocmds*

gita provids the following |User| auto commands (|autocmd|):

					*GitaStatusModifiedPre*
GitaStatusModifiedPre		Called just after an action or command which
				may modify the status of the git repository.
				It is used to clear a repository cache to
				correctly update statusline or so on.

						*GitaStatusModifiedPost*
GitaStatusModifiedPost		Called just after |GitaStatusModifiedPre|
				autocmd has called. It is used to update
				content of non-file like buffer such as
				|gita-status|.

					*GitaActionCalledPre:{name}*
GitaActionCalledPre:{name}	Called just before a {name} action is called.
				For example, GitaActionCalledPre:common:help
				is called just before |common:help| action is
				called.

					*GitaActionCalledPost:{name}*
GitaActionCalledPost:{name}	Called just after a {name} action is called.

FAQ						*gita-faq*

Q. Does gita provides git log interface?

A. No for now. You may want to check cohama/agit.vim which provides a rich
   repository viewer (which I use for now).

   https://github.com/cohama/agit.vim

Q. Encoding of |gita-blame-navi| or whatever is wrongly assigned.

A. Use |++enc| option of |:edit| command like below to reload the content with
   proper encoding:
>
	:edit ++enc=euc-jp
<
Q. I found bugs, unexpected behaviors, or whatever

A. Open an issue on https://github.com/lambdalisue/gita/issues
   Do not forget to provides 1) environmental information, 2) minimal vimrc,
   3) reproduce procedure.

Q. I would like to use bars (|) to connect commands of gita, is it possible?

A. No. |:Gita| command does not support |command-bar| so if you desire, you
   need to define your custom gita command (say, :GitaBar) like:
>
	command! -nargs=* -range -bang -bar
	      \ -complete=customlist,gita#command#complete
	      \ GitaBar
	      \ call gita#command#command(<q-bang>, [<line1>, <line2>], <q-args>)
<
	Then the new :GitaBar command supports bars like:
>
	:Gita add % | Gita commit
	" => Does not work properly
	:GitaBar add % | Gita commit
	" => Works as expect

Q. I would like to use thinca/qfreplace.vim or similar |quickfix| manipulation
   plugins to edit lines found by :|Gita-grep| command.

A. Use quickfix:quickfix action to apply candidates to |quickfix| window and
   use |GitaActionCalledPost:{name}| autocmd to call the plugin function like:
>
	augroup gita_qfreplace
	  autocmd! *
	  autocmd User GitaActionCalledPost:quickfix:quickfix
	        \ call qfreplace#start('')
	augroup END
